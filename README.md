# Front-end Framework Starter

OpenFin is framework agnostic. Our documentation and our example repos do not use a specific frontend framework and use JavaScript/TypeScript and css. If you are using a frontend framework and are looking to get started with OpenFin with have created some basic examples to help get you started.

Deeper coverage of the OpenFin capability is covered by the [Container Starters](https://github.com/built-on-openfin/container-starter) and [Workspace Starters](https://github.com/built-on-openfin/workspace-starter).

## Frameworks

The frameworks with examples can be found in the following folders.
