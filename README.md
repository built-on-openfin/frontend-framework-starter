# Front-end Framework Starter

OpenFin is framework agnostic. Our documentation and example repos do not use a specific frontend framework and use JavaScript/TypeScript and css where possible. If you are using a frontend framework and are looking to get started with OpenFin we have created some basic examples to help you get started.

Deeper coverage of the OpenFin capability is covered by the [Container Starters](https://github.com/built-on-openfin/container-starter) and [Workspace Starters](https://github.com/built-on-openfin/workspace-starter).
